<p>Replace what's exposed. For a home with plaster walls, wood paneling, or other functions that make it tough to get to in-wall pipes, think about a minimum of changing pipes that aren't buried in the walls.

Toilets should absolutely never wobble, shift, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

WaterBoss water softener systems feature a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener returns to service, supplying the entire home with clean, soft water.</p>
