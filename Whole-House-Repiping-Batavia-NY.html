<p>How to install or replace a garbage disposal. Toilet performance- The greater the performance of the toilet, the more it costs. The effectiveness of your toilet is determined in gallons per flush (GPF), so the lower the GPF, the more effective your toilet is. Learn if there are any lead pipes in the house. Homes that were built prior to 1986 frequently have lead or galvanized plumbing. Lead, as you know, no matter how beneficial, is an environmental contaminant (note the need for unleaded fuel and paint in houses that is not lead based). If you have kids, you might not wish to reside in a house that has lead pipes.</p>
<p>Contact your backflow prevention assembly maker or the product spec sheets to verify that the assembly is USC-approved You need to also verify the assembly is authorized in the orientation for which it is being installed (horizontal, vertical, and so on).
