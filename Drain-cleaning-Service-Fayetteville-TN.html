<p>Storage facilities and rise tanks are typically installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, usually in between and aqueduct and the circulation water mains. These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water products and consist of water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Given that water demand varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water circulation is higher than demand (usually night-time hours), the excess water system is safely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate exceeds supply (usually throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
