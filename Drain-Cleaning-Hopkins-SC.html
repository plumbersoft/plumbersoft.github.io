All the materials will rehabilitate the interior of your pipes without needing to completely replace them. How old is the plumbing in your home? Well, first let's ask you a different question: How old is your house? If it was built before 1970, it might have pipes made from an out-of-date product that will start to provide you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently). And if your home was built prior to The second world war, then it likely requires replacements for its old pipes, probably whole-house repiping.</p>
