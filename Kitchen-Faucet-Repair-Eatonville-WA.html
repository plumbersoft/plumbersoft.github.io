<h3>Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Eatonville WA</h3>
<p>Warning: If utilized on a water system where a pump and pressure tank provides the water (like is used on most rural homes that have a well), the PVB might spit water each time the pump turns off. This is due to the fact that the pressure variations brought on by the pump and pressure tank system can cause backflow from the watering system back into the water system. The likelihood of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB might still spill a little water with the check valve installed, nevertheless in many cases it must be much less water.</p>

It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In basic operational usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and blocks the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, enabling the device to drain in addition to preventing back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really crucial here.  This device just breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not protect versus back pressure.
