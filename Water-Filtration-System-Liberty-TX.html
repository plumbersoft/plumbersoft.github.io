<p>Scrape off the old putty with a plastic putty knife so you don't scratch the sink. Seal the brand-new basket in the sink with plumber's putty as shown in Image 4. Plumber's putty can not be utilized on specific brand-new sinks, however these will be identified to that result. Use a non-water-based silicone if you can't utilize plumber's putty. Excess putty will eject between the new basket strainer and the sink when you tighten the locknut in place. Clean it off with a rag or paper towel. Make certain to insert the cardboard friction ring in between the rubber gasket and the locknut so the locknut spins easily, without capturing on the gasket.</p>
