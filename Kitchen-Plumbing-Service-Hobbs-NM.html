As soon as a person ends up being a certified tester, there is a likelihood the individual knows how to evaluate a backflow preventer. Regrettably, this does not imply the individual knows how to repair a backflow preventer. Sometimes it is assumed if you can evaluate them, you can repair them. This is not real.
