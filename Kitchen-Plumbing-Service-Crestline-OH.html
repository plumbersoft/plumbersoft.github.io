<h3>Plumbers And House Plumbing Crestline OH</h3>
<p>Close all exterior doors and windows and turn on your bathroom and kitchen exhaust fans. Then open a close-by warm water faucet till you hear the gas burner in the hot water heater spark. After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke needs to be drawn up the vent pipe. The fumes from the burner aren't venting if the smoke doesn't draw. Switch off the gas to the water heater and call a licensed plumber to correct the issue.</p>
<p>Another drawback of water softening through ion exchange is the possible health threat for individuals on low sodium diets. Ion exchange increases the quantity of sodium in water, in order to lower its mineral content. Usually, this procedure adds 7.5 milligrams of sodium per quart of water, depending upon how hard the water was to start with. More difficult water will lead to more salt, as there will be more salt ions exchanged for mineral ions. For the majority of people, this increase in salt is minor, but if you have actually been encouraged by a physician to follow a rigorous low salt diet plan this increase can pose problems.</p>
