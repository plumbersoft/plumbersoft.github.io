<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Division, an MTS uses 40% to 50% less regrowth water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Rather than a large, single tank or twin alternating system that has been sized to handle peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to effectively get used to your service' flow rates throughout the day. Throughout periods of high flow demand, tanks come on-line to add flow rate capacity. Throughout durations of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line. This brand-new technique to softening is called progressive or responsive circulation technology, and it's perhaps the most essential development in commercial water conditioning in the past 50 years.</p>
