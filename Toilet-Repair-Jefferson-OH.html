<p>Sediment Build-Up: If you notice odd popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your unit, this could be a sign that sediment has actually developed in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating component. Running out of hot water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is using up more area in the tank, so your water therefore takes longer to heat. To fix this issue, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
