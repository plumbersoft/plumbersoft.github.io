After a minute, move a smoking match around the edge of the draft hood (Picture 7) on top of the heater. The smoke ought to be drawn up the vent pipe.

When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
