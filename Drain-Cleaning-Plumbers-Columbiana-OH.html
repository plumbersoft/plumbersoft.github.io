<p>Storage facilities and surge tanks are normally set up at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically between and aqueduct and the distribution water mains. These are centers created for the short-term staging of water materials and consist of water towers, tanks, tanks, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best thought of as circulation regulators rather than water storage units. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly continuous, use never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is greater than need (typically night-time hours), the excess water system is securely and cleanly saved for later usage when demand rate goes beyond supply (normally throughout the work day, though with some variations from morning to afternoon and night).</p>
