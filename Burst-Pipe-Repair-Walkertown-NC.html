<h3>Hiring The Services Of A Professional Plumbing Service Provider Walkertown NC</h3>
<p>Warning: If used on a water supply where a pump and pressure tank supplies the water (like is utilized on a lot of rural homes that have a well), the PVB may spit water each time the pump shuts down. Because the pressure variations triggered by the pump and pressure tank system can trigger backflow from the watering system back into the water system, this is. The possibility of water spitting, and the quantity of water that spits out, both increase with a longer mainline on the watering system. So if you have 10 feet (3m) of mainline between the PVB and the farthest valve there is less most likely to be water spitting than if you have 500 feet (150m) of mainline pipe. One way to stop, or a minimum of lower, this water spillage is to install a spring-loaded check valve right after the PVB. The PVB may still spill a little water with the check valve set up, nevertheless in most cases it must be much less water.</p>
