<h3>Before Calling For Emergency Plumbing On Your Flooded Toilet Manor TX</h3>
<p>When a water supply is being de-pressurized for a repair, it is very important to make certain a backflow condition is not produced. The repair service technician must be careful to not produce a backsiphonage condition by draining the water from a higher elevations to lower elevation. This backsiphonage condition could lead to a contamination of the plumbing system if the backflow prevention assembly was set up as a service security assembly. Abrams, Paul.
