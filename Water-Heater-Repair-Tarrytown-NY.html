PEX is simple to install, which means the cost of installation may be low as well. There is some threat of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is rare.

<h3>Trusted Home Plumbing Services Tarrytown NY</h3>
<p>Often, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
