There are a number of ways property owners can unclog a kitchen sink, consisting of using a sink plunger, snaking the drain, or using an option of vinegar and baking soda. For the more serious clogged kitchen sinks, call your local Roto-Rooter plumber.</p>

Big restaurants, hotels, factories and kitchens that handle high volumes of waste will require a heavy duty commercial garbage disposal.</p>
