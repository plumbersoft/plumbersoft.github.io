<p>Salt consumption from softened water can be prevented by leaving one kitchen tap unsoftened for drinking and cooking. Replacing potassium chloride for sodium chloride might be suitable if health or environmental factors require limiting salt. Over time, the beads end up being covered with minerals and need to be cleaned up. This cleaning procedure, called regeneration, has three cycles: recharge, rinse and backwash. The regeneration process can be scheduled immediately with an electrical timer, through a mechanical water meter, or a computer.</p>
