<p>To assist prevent clogs within the tee (an effect of the baffle inside ), some plumbers will connect the disposer discharge straight to the tee of an end-outlet constant waste, instead of use the method set out above. It's easy for waste from the disposer to clog it up due to the fact that the baffle effectively cuts in half the interior diameter of the tee. This is especially real when the waste should take a trip horizontally (down the arm) and then change direction to fall down the trap. Having the disposer discharge straight down into the tee allows for a direct line to the trap that's fairly friction-free. In this set-up, a waste arm runs in between the other sink drain and the tee.</p>
