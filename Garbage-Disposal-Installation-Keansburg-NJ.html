If it remains in a garage and a little slow leak, schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and guarantee absolutely nothing is near the heater that might be potentially damaged. Leaking hot water heater can burst causing water damage and flooding of homes.</p>

Harder water will lead to more salt, as there will be more sodium ions exchanged for mineral ions.
