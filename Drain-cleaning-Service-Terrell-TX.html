<p>In time, the resin beads in the water softener will become covered with calcium and magnesium ions, diminishing their capability to soften difficult water. Through a procedure called regeneration, water is immediately flushed through the water softener with a concentrated quantity of regenerant. Now the resin beads get the soft ions from the regenerant in exchange for the solidity on the beads. WaterBoss water softener systems include a whole home water filtration with its trademarked self-cleaning dirt and sediment filter, so both the liquified rock and dirt and sediment are sent out down the drain. With the resin beads recharged," the water softener goes back to service, providing the whole home with clean, soft water.</p>
<p>SofTap's water softening technology is appropriate for household, commercial, and commercial applications, consisting of the prevention of limescale build-up in families and scaling in commercial water treatment systems, along with improving current reverse osmosis treatment systems.
