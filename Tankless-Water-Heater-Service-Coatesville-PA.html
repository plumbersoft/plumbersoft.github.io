<p>In this circumstance, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. Double flush valves are becoming more and more typical, as both manufacturers and consumers seek new methods to conserve water. Dual flush toilets permit the user to choose the level of water needed to flush the toilet based on whether the waste is liquid or strong. We have actually all heard the old expression, "If it's yellow, let it mellow. If it's brown, flush it down."

For this reason, the RPZ must be set up in locations that are not subject to water damage and allow appropriate drainage.</p>
