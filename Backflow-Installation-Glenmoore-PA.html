In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future.
