<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver lady believed the cost she paid for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, but doing a couple of things in a different way might have conserved her a great deal of cash. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the exact same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then unfavorable or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
