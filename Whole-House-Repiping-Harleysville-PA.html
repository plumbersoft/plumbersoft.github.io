<p>Require backflow prevention assemblies and assemblies within a facility as detailed in the state needed plumbing codes. The water providers normally do not have the capability to repeatedly inspect every customer's premises for cross-connections and backflow defense. Generally, this would include the water service connection to each committed fire security system or watering piping system and the water service connection to each of the following types of properties: (1) facilities with an auxiliary or recovered water system; (2) commercial, medical, laboratory, other or marine facilities where objectionable substances are dealt with in a manner that could cause contamination or contamination of the public water system; (3) premises exempt from the State Plumbing Code inspection and premises where an internal backflow prevention assembly required under the State Plumbing Code is not correctly installed or maintained; (4) classified or restricted centers; and (5) high structures.</p>
