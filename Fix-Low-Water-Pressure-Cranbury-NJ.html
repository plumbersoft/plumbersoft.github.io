Therefore, there is a device on each control valve that either avoids the valve from being closed or sends an alarm when it is closed.

These are facilities developed for the short-term staging of water materials and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary tanks, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage units. Considering that water demand differs throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain roughly consistent, use never ever exactly matches supply.
