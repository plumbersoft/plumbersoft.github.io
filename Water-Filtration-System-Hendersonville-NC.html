As rust and minerals develop with time, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure.

<p>Recent Evaluation: Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was rather sensible. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was super pleased with their service.</p>
