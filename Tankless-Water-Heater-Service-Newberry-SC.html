<p>Backflow is bad news. Clamp the drain hose. The water softener needs to drain the depleted salt water option after the regrowth cycle. Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes should have an air space. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air space might be utilized to attain this, and may be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>

A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is happening.
