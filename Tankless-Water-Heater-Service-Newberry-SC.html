Clamp the drain hose firmly and feed it into the devoted drain, like a floor drain or energy sink. To prevent the hose back siphoning waste water, all drain tubes should have an air space. The end of the hose be at least 2 inches above the devoted drain. An air space might be utilized to attain this, and may be required depending upon local plumbing codes.</p>

A toilet auger works the opposite method that a plunger does. Instead of dislodging the obstruction with unfavorable pressure, it actually presses into the obstruction, working even more into where the obstruction is happening.
