<p>Storage centers and surge tanks are generally installed at the terminus of the water conveyance system, typically in between and aqueduct and the circulation water pipe. These are centers designed for the short-term staging of water supplies and include water towers, tanks, cisterns, secondary reservoirs, and lined ponds. These are best considered circulation regulators instead of water storage systems. Considering that water need varies throughout the day while the pipe flow rates from the water source remain approximately continuous, usage never ever precisely matches supply. As so for those durations where water flow is higher than need (generally night-time hours), the excess water supply is securely and easily kept for later use when need rate exceeds supply (typically throughout the work day, though with some variations from early morning to afternoon and evening).</p>
