<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the price she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a couple of things differently could have saved her a great deal of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line connected to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, lower or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will follow and cause a vacuum or siphonage from the service line.</p>
<p>Wait up until it's set up under the sink if you have to hardwire the unit. Keep in mind: It's probably a great idea to shut off power at the breaker now, so as to avoid forgetting to shut it off later.
