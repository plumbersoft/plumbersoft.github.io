<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance issue for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be eliminated by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are available. Once again, it is a good idea to examine the manufacturer's directions for unique precautions.</p>
<p>If you're buying a brand-new toilet, you need to understand the rough-in" measurement of the old one. For the vast bulk of toilets, the waste pipe is focused about 12 in. from the wall. But with a couple of models, that measurement is 10 in. or 14 in. To inspect the rough-in, just determine from the wall to the toilet's hold-down bolts. Toilet shopping will be a bit harder if that measurement (plus the density of the baseboard) isn't roughly 12 in.. A lot of house centers bring just one or two 10-in. models and no 14-in. designs. If you need to special-order a toilet, be prepared to invest much more. If there's a door near the toilet, also measure how far the bowl protrudes from the wall. If you are changing a toilet with a basic bowl with an extended" design, the door might not close. Read on to find out how to install a toilet.</p>
