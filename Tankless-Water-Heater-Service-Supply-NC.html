<p>Unlike salt-based water softeners which utilize a procedure called ion exchange to remove hard water minerals, salt-free water softeners utilize a physical process known as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC). This procedure transforms the hardness-causing minerals in the water to a solidity crystal that won't stay with any surface area in your house, keeping your home appliances and warm water heaters free of difficult water scale build up. Salt-free softeners are likewise called water conditioners because they do not really soften" the water; They condition (or reduce the effects of) it. And due to the fact that these types of systems do not trap any minerals, there's no need for a cleaning cycle to eliminate recorded ions.</p>
