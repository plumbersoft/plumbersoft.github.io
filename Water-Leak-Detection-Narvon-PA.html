<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the most basic and most common kind of device. It has two check valves in a totally closed body-- two layers of backflow protection. No matter how large the valve is, all DCs are equipped with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario.

If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might take place. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company considers high risk" establishments.</p>
