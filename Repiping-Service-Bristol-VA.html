<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the rate she paid for a plumber to replace her garbage disposal was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a brand-new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things differently could have saved her a lot of cash. For instance, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or reduced pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>

<p>Recent Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. They replaced my kitchen faucet and included two new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather affordable. I will certainly utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
