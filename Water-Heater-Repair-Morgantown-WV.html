<p>The majority of the times, the gas leak is caused by a change that in some way affects the gas lines. Something as insignificant as moving a gas clothes dryer for any function whatsoever can damage the gas pipe. Gas lines which are flexible are susceptible to crimping and leaking, others made from unsuitable, low-grade material likewise end up being breakable quickly and corrode away, causing a serious leak. Many times, an installation by unprofessional also cause gas leaks. Which is why we are always advising to just rely on the most knowledgeable, professional, and licensed plumbers for installation and gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Copper piping in the Florida area is particularly vulnerable to recurring pinhole leakages (corrosion that breaks through the surface area of piping), so keep an eye out for bluish-greenish rust on copper piping.

All leaks, worn fittings, and other plumbing problems will be resolved.</p>
