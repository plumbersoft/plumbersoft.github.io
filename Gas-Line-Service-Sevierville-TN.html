There are 2 main type of backflow preventers, and each has its own maintenance requirements. Double check valve assembly (DCV) and reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZ) gadgets are most commonly used in commercial centers.</p>
<p>A check backflow device (DC) is the easiest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow security. No matter how big the valve is, all DCs are geared up with 1-pound springs that hold the check valves closed during a backflow scenario. Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately evaluate a backflow preventer. The device passes if each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge. That means that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The downside of a DC is that if the very first line of defense stops working and the second line of defense stops working (both check valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might happen. That is why this type of valve is not specified for what a water company thinks about high risk" facilities.</p>
