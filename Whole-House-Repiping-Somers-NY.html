<p>Main sewer repair includes extensive excavation, fortifying supporting walls, eliminating and relaying pipe and connections, backfilling, and installing plates for temporary cover. Service lines which stem from personal property and feed into the main line are a normal area for leakages or breaks. Off-road tasks outside the right of way need a good deal of manual work for excavation and carrying materials, rock, and dirt to and from the site.</p>
<p>In some cases a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain won't fix the concern. You may have to look into using a high pressure water system to remove the clog. This process is a bit more costly and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending upon the intensity of the clog. At the time of inspection, make sure to leave all of the gas piping exposed so the inspector can take a look at the whole system.</p>
