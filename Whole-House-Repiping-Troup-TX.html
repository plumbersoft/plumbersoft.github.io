<p>The waste disposal unit is humming, however not turning. The waste disposal unit has ended up being jammed. IF IT IS JAMMED, NEVER STICK YOUR HAND INTO THE DISPOSAL. Even if the system is off, the blades are sharp and dangerous. Make certain the unit is off, you can even switch off the breaker to ensure it can't be switched on by mishap. Your garbage disposal includes a. hex wrench that can be used to place into the opening located at the bottom of the unit. Try to insert a broom manage or plunger into the sink drain opening and attempt to rotate the jammed flywheel if you can't find this wrench. If it seems to be moving easily turn the unit back on (and do not forget to turn back on the circuit breaker if you don't it off) and see if the system is working.</p>
<p>Pests. Unfortunately, a damaged main sewer line can also lead to undesirable pests inside your house. Rats and insects can quickly squeeze through cracks and gaps in your sewer line and find their method into your plumbing. These insects can be very harmful to your health.
