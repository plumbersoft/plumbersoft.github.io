If pushing down on the flapper stops the sound, the flapper isn't sealing under normal pressure. Switch off the water, flush the toilet to clear the tank and then run your finger around the rim of the flush valve seat. If you feel mineral deposits, clean the flush valve seat with an abrasive sponge or ScotchBrite pad. Do not use anything that may roughen it.

<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the normal solution is to have the malfunctioning pipes replaced.

Steel was the most popular choice for house plumbing for numerous years, but steel ultimately experiences corrosion and lacks the resilience of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
