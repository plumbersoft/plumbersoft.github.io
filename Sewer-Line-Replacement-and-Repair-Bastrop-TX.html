<p>According to the Canature WaterGroup Commercial Industrial Engineering Department, an MTS utilizes 40% to 50% less regeneration water and salt compared to traditional softening systems. Instead of a big, single tank or twin rotating system that has been sized to deal with peak flow rates, an MTS uses a series of smaller sized tanks to efficiently get used to your organisation' circulation rates throughout the day. During periods of high flow need, tanks come online to include flow rate capability. Throughout periods of low circulation demand, tanks go off-line.
