Lube does not help the assembly work any better, it is just there to help the service technician assemble the components into the body without developing damage from friction. The lubricant needs to be a food grade lube to guarantee the water supply is not polluted. In many cases the very best lube is water. The typical use for lube in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings must be gently lubricated to guarantee they do not roll out of their retainer. Making use of excessive lube can trigger the backflow prevention assembly to fail or use out earlier by bring in dirt and debris or limiting the movement of the element. The appropriate amount of lube should make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You need to never ever see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>
<p>In some situations, the required toilet repair surpasses the investment of a new toilet.
