If you smell a gas leak in or around your house, there are safety precautions you should require to protect yourself, your household and your house. Some jurisdictions also enable alternatives to backflow preventers. For example, Philadelphia's water district needs all residential systems providing dedicated sprinkler heads to have a connection from the sprinkler system to the toilet tank that's farthest from the water system. This eliminates the need for a backflow preventer, since every time that toilet is flushed, it draws water through the fire line to keep the water fresh.</p>
