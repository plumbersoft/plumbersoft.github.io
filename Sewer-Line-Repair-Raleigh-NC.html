<p>Iron fouling is another typical maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, minimized iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has actually already been fouled, commercial cleaners are offered. Once again, it is suggested to check the producer's guidelines for special preventative measures.</p>
<p>The purpose of the Information Inspection (permit) is to have the plumbing contractor meet an inspector at the task website to examine a proposed installation, which may not remain in conformance with the code. The proposal to differ the code is submitted in duplicate, in writing or with understandable drawings, and specifies the factor for deviation. The proposition may be considered and approved, if it satisfies the intent of the plumbing code.</p>
