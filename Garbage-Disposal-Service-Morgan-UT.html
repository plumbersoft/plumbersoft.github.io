<p>Using dissimilar metals in the plumbing can lead to galvanic deterioration Direct contact between dissimilar metals will start the development of a galvanic cell, which is developed whenever two different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and after that immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created since of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight linked to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not totally avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating product that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
