<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, wireless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman thought the price she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much. Jean Waite paid $856 for a new kitchen garbage disposal. She wasn't over charged, however doing a few things differently could have conserved her a lot of money. For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the very same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, decreased or then negative pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
