Lots of problems can be fixed by a simple call to S & D Plumbing; we can send out a professional out to clean out clogs and repair jammed blades.

<p>Iron fouling is another common maintenance problem for water softeners. Although colorless, decreased iron will be eliminated by the system, red-oxidized iron (iron that has actually been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening insures that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. Commercial cleaners are readily available if the resin has actually currently been fouled. Once again, it is recommended to examine the producer's directions for unique safety measures.</p>
