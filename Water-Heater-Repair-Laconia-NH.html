<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several afflicted locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to just abandon the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
