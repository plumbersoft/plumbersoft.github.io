<h3>Licensed Plumbing & HVAC Company In Willoughby OH</h3>
<p>As with kitchen sink drains, a bathroom drain (whether it's your shower, sink, or bathtub) can be corrected easily if the obstruction is shallow and simple. For a lot of clogs you'll just need a plunger, and in some cases some chemicals, however if this does not resolve the problem then you may also need to call in a drain professional like Reckon & Reckon to help. As a bathroom drain is also harder to replace and repair than a kitchen sink drain, it's more likely that you'll need a professional plumber's services.</p>
<p>Water softening is the removal of calcium, magnesium, and specific other metal cations in tough water. The resulting soft water is more compatible with soap and extends the life time of some devices. Water softening is usually achieved using ion-exchange resins. The garbage disposal is leaking from below your sink. Push the tip of a screwdriver up against the edge of the plug and tap till you break loose the plug. Then remove this plastic disc from inside the disposal (you can most likely hold the unit upside down and shake it out).</p>
