Double flush valves are ending up being more and more common, as both consumers and makers look for brand-new methods to conserve water.

<p>Soda dispensers (post-mix carbonators) use carbonated water mixed under pressure with syrup and water to provide sodas beverages. Many, if not most, water pipes are made from copper.
