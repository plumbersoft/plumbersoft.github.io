<p>The waste disposal unit as we understand it today was initially offered to Americans in the mid-1930s. The units exploded in popularity during the 1940s through word-of-mouth. Today, it's approximated that over 50% of American families have a waste disposal unit in their kitchen. CenterPoint Energy's House Service Plus uses you an optional Pipe Security Prepare for only $3.95 a month.
