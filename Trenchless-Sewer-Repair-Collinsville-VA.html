An approved, effectively installed and maintained backflow assembly basically eliminates the threat of backflow from either backpressure or backsiphonage. Electric water heaters have a shorter lifespan than gas water heaters of similar quality and capability. Still, the difference is insufficient to make any significant modifications in the cost savings a gas heater will bring. Where a gas heater might last 8-15 years, the electric option will last about 8-12 years.</p>
<p>If you home utilizes a septic system and drain field, you'll need an unique garbage disposal. The unit needs to grind the waste even finer to avoid blockages and permit the tank to be able to drain properly into the leach fields.
