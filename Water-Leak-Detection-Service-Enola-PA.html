<p>A couple of local authorities need that the PVB be installed within 18 inches (450mm) of the connection to the water source, in which case you can't use a PVB unless the water source is at the high end of the irrigated area. It may not be set up in any place where it might ever be submerged under water. Some towns do not allow the usage of PVBs with drip watering systems. Some do not allow the usage of a PVB at all, so contact your water provider. A PVB backflow preventer may spit or spill water out from under the cap when backflow takes place, so it must be installed in a place where water spillage would not trigger problems.</p>
