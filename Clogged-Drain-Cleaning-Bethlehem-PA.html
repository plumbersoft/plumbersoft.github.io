<p>While the expenses to repipe a home varies with each project and across the United States, it will usually cost $600 to $2,000 to repipe a single feature (toilet, tub, etc.) and you can expect to pay anywhere from $4,000 to $15,000 for a total piping system replacement. More serious cross-connection hazards might require an unique kind of backflow preventer that can automatically discharge potentially polluted water before it enters the public water supply.

Licensing typically requires an examination or work experience or both. Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.</p>

PEX is easy to install, which suggests the cost of installation might be low as well. There is some threat of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is rare. In general, it's a cost-effective solution that will stand the test of time. We typically recommend this product, though it will depend.</p>
