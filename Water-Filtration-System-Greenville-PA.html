<h3>Most Common Residential Plumbing Emergencies Greenville PA</h3>
<p>The rust inside the pipe can break off and be carried out through the taps. This will trigger your water to look rusty or brown, and the water may have a bad or foul odor to it. When the piping in your house starts to show any of these signs of corrosion, you will inevitably need to repipe the whole plumbing system.
