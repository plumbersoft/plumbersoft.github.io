The repair might be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
