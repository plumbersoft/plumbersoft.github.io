Plus, a brand-new toilet might make your bathroom remodel sizzle.</p>
<p>A water softener has a resin tank including countless tiny resin beads that hold electrically charged ions. The beads end up being full of sodium ions from the water softener salt when newly restored.

The softener system then delivers soft water for your use. Difficult water triggers white or gray deposits when water is heated. Water softening can be used to lower these symptoms.</p>
