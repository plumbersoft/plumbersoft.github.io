If you do not detect the odor coming from the sewer backup, you may recognize this issue because a backup occurs whenever you flush the toilet or run water in your bathtub or sink. Every drain in your home is dependent upon the main sewer line for proper drainage. If, nevertheless, just one drain has backup problems, there's a separated issue with only that drain, which is not likely to be a sewage problem.</p>

Most residential water heaters cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electric, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas water heaters with special venting systems also are available. But they're more difficult to install, and we will not deal with them here.</p>
