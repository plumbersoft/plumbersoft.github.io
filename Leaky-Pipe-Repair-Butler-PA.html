Call (866) 701-5306 to set up an appointment. A climatic vacuum breaker (AVB) is not a testable backflow preventer and is not typically specified by water purveyors.  It consists of an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental operational use, water pressure presses the seat up and shuts off the air inlet.  When the water flow stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, allowing the device to drain in addition to avoiding back siphonage.  The word siphonage" is really essential here.  This device only breaks the vacuum to drain water and will not secure against back pressure.

<p>Lubrication may help with the positioning of some elements within the body of the backflow prevention assembly. Lubricant does not help the assembly work any much better, it is only there to help the service technician assemble the elements into the body without producing damage from friction. The lubricant should be a food grade lubricant to ensure the water system is not infected. In most cases the very best lube is water. The typical use for lubricant in the repair procedure, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly lubed to assure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of excessive lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to wear or stop working out faster by drawing in dirt and debris or restricting the movement of the element. The proper amount of lubricant need to make the surface area of the 'ring appear wet. You must never ever see pieces or globs of lube.</p>

<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is warmed straight whenever it's needed. Tankless systems specifically utilize a component that warms up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is instantly turned off, the water stops being heated up. The heating temperature level is generally pre-set to match your choices and needs. Since they just heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters use less power than traditional water heaters.</p>
