Well, first let's ask you a different concern: How old is your home? If it was developed prior to 1970, it may have pipes made from an outdated material that will start to give you problems in the not-too-distant future (if they have not currently).

For example, if you have a 2 piece toilet, the tank to bowl gasket is your first line of defense versus leakages in between the tank and bowl. As it gets used, it can start to crack and solidify or merely be so squished that it does not fill the space along with it used to, and you wind up with water all over the location. Similar to with the gasket, in some cases your tank to bowl bolts and washers can end up being so worn or corroded that they spring a leak. Whenever you replace your flush valve, we highly suggest also changing your gasket and your bolt set to ensure everything remains in tip-top shape.</p>
