<p>Looking to repair or replace your garbage disposal? At Service Professor, gas line repairs are more than an added service that we offer. They are a specific area that our professionals excel in.

<p>Disposers attach to the sink drain fittings in a number of ways-some use threaded plastic nuts, others big hose clamps-but the mounting-ring assembly revealed here is the most common. To remove the disposer, support it from below and rotate the large, 3-tab mounting ring at the top counterclockwise up until the unit falls away. Get rid of the rest of the drain assembly by loosening the three bolts and prying off the keeping ring. Push the drain out through the sink hole and clear away any old caulk or putty.</p>

<p>Cleaning your drain is a vital part of maintenance. You must be frequently monitoring your water drainage and cleaning your drains accordingly.

Contact your state's licensing board for additional information.</p>

Call 240-241-5060 today or call us online to schedule commercial water heater services. CPVC pipes = $0.50-$ 0.60 per linear foot.
