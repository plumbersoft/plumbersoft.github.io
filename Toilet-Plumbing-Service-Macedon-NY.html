As soon as the tank rusts through, there is no way to repair it; replacement is the only solution. Turn the garbage disposal over and eliminate electrical cover plate. Pull out wires. Insert cable connector (not included) and run electrical cable through access hole on bottom of waste disposal unit. Tighten up cable connector. Press wires into waste disposal unit (do not displace cardboard guard) and replace electrical cover plate.</p>
