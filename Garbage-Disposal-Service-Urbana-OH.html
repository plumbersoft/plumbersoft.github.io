When you experience a plumbing problem it may be a small leak or a more major situation. , if you have a problem with the sewer line it is a very serious issue that needs instant attention..

<p>Backflow is water flowing in the opposite instructions from its normal circulation. IRWD's safe and clean water supply is designed to keep the water streaming to you. When hydraulic conditions within any water system deviate from "normal," the instructions of water flow can be reversed. This creates a backflow condition and the capacity for polluted water going into the safe and clean water circulation system. Copper is a biostatic product, which indicates germs will not grow on it. Copper has been used (along with PVC pipes) considering that the 1970s to replace galvanized iron pipes in old buildings. It is specifically beneficial for hot and cold faucet water and refrigerant lines in A/C systems.</p>
<p>On May 1st of 2007 WSSC Water embraced the International Plumbing and Fuel Gas Codes. Consequently residential permits issued after that date need a testable backflow assembly for the fire sprinkler system. The assembly was tested at installation and a WSSC Water test tag with the date it was evaluated was attached. By code this backflow assembly need to be tested every year. Likewise permits provided for sub-meters with backflow preventers for yard irrigation systems need an each year test. It is needed that this assembly is evaluated in the spring before running the watering system. All testable backflow preventers need to be tested each year to insure the security of the potable drinking water in your home.

<p>The use of dissimilar metals in the plumbing can result in galvanic corrosion Direct contact between dissimilar metals will initiate the formation of a galvanic cell, which is created whenever 2 different kinds of metal are conductively connected to each other, and then immersed in an electrolyte such as water. Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be rusted and an electrical current is created since of the procedure. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals. A dielectric coupling contains an insulating material that physically separates contact between the two metals.</p>
