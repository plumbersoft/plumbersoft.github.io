Tough water does not start out hard-- rather, it picks up mineral deposits as it is available in contact with limestone underground. These mineral deposits remain when the water is routed into pipes for commercial and residential usage, unless the water is softened or filtered.</p>
<p>Picture this scenario: Your spouse invites a few of his good friends over to see the game and they come over with their children and better halves. You have actually been observing that whenever you flush the toilet, the water a little rises but then drains, albeit slower than typical. Because your other half is serving beverages with the tasty food you have prepared, the number of toilet visits increase. Your toilet, therefore, gives up and simply when one of the spouses flushes it, the water levels increase as typical but this time, it doesn't drain.</p>
