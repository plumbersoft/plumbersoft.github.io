It contains an air inlet valve, check seat, and air inlet port.  In fundamental functional usage, water pressure pushes the seat up and closes off the air inlet.  When the water circulation stops, it falls back down to open the air inlet port and breaks the vacuum, permitting the device to drain as well as avoiding back siphonage.

All 'rings need to be lightly oiled to ensure they do not present of their retainer. Making use of too much lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to stop working or use out sooner by drawing in dirt and particles or limiting the motion of the part.
