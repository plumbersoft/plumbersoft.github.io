The lubricant must be a food grade lubricant to guarantee the water supply is not infected. In many cases the very best lubricant is water. The normal usage for lubricant in the repair process, is on 'rings (not guides). All 'rings need to be lightly lubed to ensure they do not roll out of their retainer. The use of excessive lube can cause the backflow prevention assembly to fail or wear out quicker by attracting dirt and debris or restricting the movement of the part. The correct amount of lube need to make the surface of the 'ring appear wet. You must never see chunks or globs of lubricant.</p>

Although colorless, minimized iron will be gotten rid of by the unit, red-oxidized iron (iron that has been exposed to air or chlorine) will clog the resin. Filtration prior to softening guarantees that oxidized iron is not processed in the softener. If the resin has currently been fouled, commercial cleaners are available.
