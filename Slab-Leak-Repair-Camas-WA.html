<p>Salt-free systems will also minimize scale accumulation and supply brighter clothing and softer skin utilizing a much healthier approach. The main advantage with salt-free systems is the ability to soften water without needing to add salt to the water. This is a more heart healthy and environmentally friendly system. Standard salt-based systems add salt to the water which can have an unfavorable impact on people with high-blood pressure and cardiovascular disease. Some cities are starting to prohibit salt-based softeners due to the high sodium content in the drainage. Salt-free systems are maintenance complimentary and utilize no drainage, no electrical power and no salt or chemicals. In contrast to salt-based systems, salt-free systems are very low maintenance because the media can last up to five years without replacing. Salt-based systems require the salt to be renewed on a monthly basis.</p>
