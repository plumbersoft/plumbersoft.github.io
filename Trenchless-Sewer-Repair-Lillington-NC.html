<p>Polybutylene Pipe Repair & Replacement: Polybutylene pipe is gray plastic water supply line pipe that was developed in the 1970s. It was in fact touted as the pipe of the future. It cost less than copper and was much easier to install. Regrettably, any home that plumbed with polybutylene is like a ticking time bomb. It is not a question of if it will leak, but when. A clogged or backed up drain pipe is a problem. Often a homeowner can unclog a drain with a commercial item or with a plunger. Sometimes unclogging a drain takes taking apart the plug and putting a hook down to take out hair and gunk. And often even then nothing gets that drain cleared, not even basing on one's head and whispering necromancies to the drain gods.</p>

<p>When a repiping service is needed, this involves eliminating harmed sections of old piping and setting up brand-new piping in its location. This is needed to stabilize the plumbing system and guarantee the structural stability. Copper piping has actually been the standard for many years and is generally deemed the premier type of repiping. We utilize Type L" copper, which is the premier grade of copper. Our company believe that if you are going to buy copper piping, do it as soon as, do it right.</p>

<p>Your old discharge tube most likely won't be the ideal length for your new disposal. If it's too long, merely connect it to the disposal, mark it and suffice with a hacksaw for your garbage disposal installation. (Loosen the other pipe connections, if required, to place the tube back into the tee.) If the old discharge tube is too brief, you may need to make a time-wasting trip to the store. To avoid this, make certain the brand-new waste disposal unit installation package consists of a tube, or buy one separately at the exact same time for about $3.</p>
