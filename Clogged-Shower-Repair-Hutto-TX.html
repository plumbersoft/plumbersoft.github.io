<p>The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop. In some cases the solution is to repair the damaged area of pipe, and an area repair is all that is needed to fix the problem. Other times a more comprehensive solution is needed: repiping. PVB assembles, intended for yard watering, are the least expensive type of whole-system backflow preventer. They are fairly easy in style and the easiest to install, keep, and repair.</p>
<p>For whole-house repiping, the choice generally comes down to copper or PEX (cross-linked polyethylene). This plastic piping is resilient and less expensive than copper. PEX is easy to install, which means the cost of installation might be low also. There is some danger of the PEX pipe splitting, though this is rare. In general, it's an economical service that will stand the test of time. We typically advise this material, though it will depend.</p>
