While there's not a precise timetable as to when you need to repipe your house, you must definitely check out repiping if they have not been performed in 50 years or more-- specifically if you reside in an older home developed closer to the turn of the last century. The Supertech serviced our ac system and got it up and running right in time for the warmer weather condition. The only thing that I would have liked was to have the tech describe what exactly was wrong with the unit, how he fixed the problem, and how to avoid a reaccuance.

Find the reset switch on the bottom of the system if so. If the clog persists, utilize any kind of drain cleaner to release it.</p>
