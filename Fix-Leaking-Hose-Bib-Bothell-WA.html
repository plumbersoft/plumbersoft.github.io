<p>Water that has actually been completely demineralized (such as RO and DI water) is starving for ions. This is what makes demineralized water-- or water in which all TDS have actually been eliminated-- corrosive. For this factor, WQA recommends that common metal pipe and fittings (e.g., copper, galvanized, brass, bronze) should not be used downstream of a RO or DI treatment system. Softeners do not get rid of the TDS and do not cause this type of rust A softener is merely catching some cations (mostly calcium and magnesium) and releasing other cations at the same time (usually sodium or often potassium).</p>
