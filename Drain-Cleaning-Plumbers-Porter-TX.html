<h3>Easy Basic Kitchen Faucet Repair at Porter TX</h3>
<p>What is difficult water? Scientifically speaking, it is water which contains significant amounts of liquified minerals, particularly calcium and magnesium. As water trickles through rocks, limestone deposits and soil, it gets these minerals on its journey. Depending upon how long the water travels through the ground prior to reaching your tap, it can pick up a great deal of these minerals, making water harder in some regions than others. While the minerals will not damage your health, they can leave insoluble mineral deposits, making the water unsuitable-- and rather a nuisance-- for its lots of desired uses around your home.</p>
<p>You count on your hot water heater every day for all the warm water you and your family need to prepare, clean, and shower. When your hot water heater stops working correctly or if it's time for an upgrade, rely on Essig Plumbing & Heating. We provide comprehensive water heater services in Reading, PA, in addition to in Berks and Lehigh counties. From water heater repairs to regular maintenance to finish replacement, our plumbing experts have you covered.</p>
<p>The term tough water" may seem like an oxymoron, however it's simply household water which contains high concentrations of dissolved minerals, specifically calcium and magnesium. These minerals don't make water unhealthy to drink. They also are relatively undetectable through smell or taste, however they can be harmful simply the very same. Just like our trenchless services, we will first carry out pipe leak tests utilizing video and hydraulic pressure tests.</p>
<p>Regrettably, when water is completely stripped of calcium and magnesium to become soft, it often ends up being destructive. Corrosive water causes leaching of copper pipes and faucet components, particularly in areas where water sits for extended periods of time. Although this is not a health concern, it is the main reason for the blue and green stains being left in your bathroom and utility room sinks. Most residential hot water heater cost $150 to $400 for either gas or electrical, plus $200 to $450 if you have a plumber install it. More costly gas hot water heater with special venting systems also are available. But they're more difficult to install, and we won't deal with them here.</p>
