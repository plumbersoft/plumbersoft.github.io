<p>Saint Paul Regional Water Services (SPRWS) needs plumbing contractors to acquire a plumbing authorization before changing a backflow or setting up preventer. Your hot water heater. The pro will next check your hot water heater. With your hot water heater, he or she is looking at water temperature level, pressure relief valves and pipes, and any rust in the tank (unless it's a tankless hot water heater ). Some will also flush your water heater at this time, which is an annual maintenance job that prevents hard water and sediment accumulation. To do this, the plumber will drain the water out of the tank with a hose and run clean water through the tank to wash out any buildup.</p>
