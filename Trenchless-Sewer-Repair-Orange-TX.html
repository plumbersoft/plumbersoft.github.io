<p>The next generation in commercial-grade, cordless water leak detection. DENVER (CBS4)- A Denver woman believed the rate she spent for a plumber to replace her waste disposal unit was too much.

For example, a 2-inch service line linked to a 6-inch supply line will have the same pressure. If there is a break or high need for the water downstream from the 6-inch service line, then negative or lower pressure in the 2-inch supply line will trigger a vacuum and follow or siphonage from the service line.</p>
