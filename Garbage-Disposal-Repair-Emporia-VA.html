<p>Loosen the screws on the upper mount ring (flange mount) enough to press the phone a bit - you'll see a small "snap ring" around the bottom of the sink flange (this ring keeps the mount ring from moving off the flange).

The flange (and associated gasket, if suitable) can now be popped out of the drain hole. Clean the area for the brand-new unit.</p>

This procedure continues till all the hardness ions are exchanged with the sodium ions (you'll discover small amounts of salt going to drain in addition to the solidity ions) and the bed is thought about totally restored.</p>
