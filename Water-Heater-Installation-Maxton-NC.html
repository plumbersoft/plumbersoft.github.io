<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based upon our experience.</p>
