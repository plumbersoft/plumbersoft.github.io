I actually received their number for another company that couldn't come quickly enough but referred me to Price Buster's. Bo and company were able to come out within 12 hours to investigate and provide me a quote. They immediately cleared the initial blockage, allowing for the tenants to return from a hotel. Unfortunately, upon further investigation, there was a substantial obstruction that required excavation to investigate. His team was on website the very next day, a Saturday mind you, to begin digging a 9 ′ hole. After fixing this preliminary problem and setting up a protective liner, it was figured out that there was yet another break existed.
