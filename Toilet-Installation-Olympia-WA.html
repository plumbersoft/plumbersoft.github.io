When the pressure drops for some reason such as might take place when the fire department links to a fire hydrant to fight a water or a fire main breaks or some other circumstance occurs, contaminated water might be drawn into the system. To prevent such an incident, there needs to be some type of backflow prevention approach used. The very best and best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap (a physical separation in between the water outlet and the rim of the fixture). If an air gap is not possible, then the proper backflow prevention device is required.
