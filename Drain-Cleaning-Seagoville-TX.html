We're truly pleased with all the work we do to keep your house comfy however we have a special affinity for water heater installation and replacement. Our advanced proficiency and experience permit us to install new units more efficiently and economically than anybody you'll find in the area.</p>
<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. Most of the times, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to add a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leakages. This is likewise a good time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Image 6). A versatile supply line enhanced with a metal sleeve costs about $7 at home centers and hardware shops. Pictures 1 - 8 show how to replace the valve. If the height of your valve is adjustable, set the height before you install the valve (Image 5). If your valve is a different design from the one we reveal, inspect the directions.

We advise setting up carbon monoxide detectors outside of bedroom doors to signal you of any potential gas leaks if you haven't done so already.</p>
