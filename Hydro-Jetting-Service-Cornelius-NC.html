Evaluate the sewer lines from property to suppress connection, sewage-disposal tank, and drainage systems to thoroughly check if pipe damage, rust, or major clogs exist. Tree roots are among the biggest reasons for a sewer line backup. As roots enter into the drain line they can cause blockages and back up into your home.</p>
<p>If you or anyone in the structure starts to experience the above noted symptoms, bear in mind of the location. If signs affect individuals in a specific place then it might be a gas leak.

How typically a toilet blockages depends on the strength of its flush, the tidiness of its drain pipes, and what it's attempting to flush.
