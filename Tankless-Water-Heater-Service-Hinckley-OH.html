<p>Your initial step is to turn off the water. In many cases, you'll have a shutoff valve right beside the toilet coming either through the floor or out of the wall. If you do not have a shutoff, turn off the supply of water at the main shutoff valve, where water enters your home. This is a good time to include a shutoff valve next to the toilet or replace one that leaks. This is likewise a great time to replace the supply line that feeds your toilet (Photo 6). A flexible supply line strengthened with a metal sleeve costs about $7 in your home centers and hardware stores. Images 1 - 8 demonstrate how to replace the valve. Set the height before you install the valve (Picture 5) if the height of your valve is adjustable. If your valve is a different design from the one we show, examine the directions. After installing the valve (Photo 6), link the fill tube (Picture 7).</p>
<p>Current Review: Button Plumbing was excellent. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually always dripped in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done quickly. The cost was quite sensible. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
<p>Sink parts that your Candu Pro can service consist of the faucet, deals with, supply lines, trap, dishwasher lines, and stopper. If you have a waste disposal unit in your sink that requires to be serviced, we can help you find a Candu Pro for that, too. Gas leak repairs cost $6 to $7 per direct foot or $75 to $150 per hour.
