<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, snake or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a newbie's DIY project. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
