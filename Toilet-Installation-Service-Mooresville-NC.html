<p>Throughout the regrowth cycle, brine (brackish water created in the salt water tank by mixing water and salt) is passed through the resin tank (either up or down depending upon the design). As this brine goes through the tank, salt ions are moved (exchanged) for the solidity ions on the exchange resin and these solidity ions are subsequently sent to drain. This process continues till all the firmness ions are exchanged with the salt ions (you'll observe percentages of salt going to drain along with the hardness ions) and the bed is considered totally regrowed.</p>
