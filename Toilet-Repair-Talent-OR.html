<p>A double check backflow device (DC) is the simplest and most common kind of device. It has 2 check valves in a completely closed body-- 2 layers of backflow protection.

Those 1-pound springs are what you are testing when you ultimately check a backflow preventer. If each check valve holds a differential of 1 pound or more on your backflow gauge, the device passes. That implies that the check valve is holding shut with at least 1 pound of force. The disadvantage of a DC is that if the first line of defense fails and the 2nd line of defense stops working (both examine valves stop working to hold), a backflow circumstance might happen.
