<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason why we will recommend a full repipe in particular communities, based upon our experience.</p>
