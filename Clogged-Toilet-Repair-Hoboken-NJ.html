Advances in plumbing technology have made commercial toilets and plumbing systems more affordable however also more complex. You need to invest a minimum of $50 to get a top quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a durable surface and a reliable stopper mechanism. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop style stopper. The spin-lock stopper does not have any parts that can wear, however screwing it in and out can be annoying. The twist-and-drop style is a lot easier to use but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
<p>If you spot a leak and select a patching job instead of a repiping job, simply keep in mind that all the pipes in your home are probably made from the same product and they might be next.

If your plumber's auger line is too brief to reach to the end of the pipe, go as far as you can from the front of the drain, then start at the end of the drain and work backwards.</p>
