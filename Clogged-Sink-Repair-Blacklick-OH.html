<p>Capacity. Capability is crucial in picking the proper hot water heater for your home. A top consider properly sizing your hot water heater is the FHR (first-hour score) is the variety of gallons of hot water that the water heater can provide in an hour when the tank is complete. If the water heater tank is too little, you won't have adequate hot water to meet your needs. If it is over-sized, it will heat up more water than you utilize which increases your energy use and energy bills.
