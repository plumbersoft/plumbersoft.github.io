<p>The United States Department of Energy states that water heating can account for 14% -25% of the energy consumed in your home." It is the second highest energy consuming area of a house, next to heating and cooling.

Check assemblies are likewise cheaper than reduced pressure zone assemblies. Nevertheless, double check valve assemblies are not approved as a backflow prevention device for water systems consisting of dangerous compounds.

In general, it's a cost-efficient solution that will stand the test of time. We frequently suggest this product, though it will depend.</p>
