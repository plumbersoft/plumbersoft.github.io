When water flow stops, pressure vacuum breakers utilize a check valve created to close with the help of a spring. Its air-inlet valve opens when the internal pressure is one psi above air pressure, preventing non-potable water from being siphoned back into the potable system. The assembly consists of durable, seated shut-off valves and testcocks.</p>
