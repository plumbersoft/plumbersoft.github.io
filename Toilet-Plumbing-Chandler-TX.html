<p>Sluggish drains. A slow drain can be a typical plumbing issue, and most clogs can be resolved with a basic fix such as a plunger or drain cleaning. If the basic unclogging approaches don't work to resolve the slow drain, the problem can be a deeper blockage somewhere in the main sewer line. Regrettably, mainline clogs are normally much larger clogs than need more than easy unclogging methods, however digging into the line itself to access the source of the issue.</p>
<p>There are 2 very good factors to insist on a sewer camera inspection of your sanitary and storm sewer before buying. If your home that you have your eye on is an older home in a fully grown neighborhood you most likely have bigger trees on or near the home.  Unfortunately where there are trees there are normally tree roots and they love to discover water inside of your sewer. There is no chance of knowing whether you have a tree root infestation without seeing it with a camera inspection. You can chance and wait on the very first rainstorm however I think you 'd rather not.</p>

<p>A partial reroute is basically a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will suggest a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
